    "- In this lab, we'll learn about topic modeling. Topic modeling uses statistics to understand what text is about, that is, to find the topics in text.\n",
    "- We'll use the online dating profile text that OKCupid made public as our example, but of course topic modeling can be used on any text.\n",

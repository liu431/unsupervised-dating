# Introduction

“So tell me about yourself!’’ This seemingly straightforward question in day-to-day interactions is usually met with silence and hesitation. That can no longer be the case for the 1.67 trillion online dating industry, which has grown exponentially in popularity over the last decade. The dating apps, such as OkCupid and Coffee Meets Bagel, are designed to help the singles ‘get to know’ other people for short or long-term romantic relationships. In order to be popular and memorable, users usually have to write a short introduction to advertise themselves. Such activity could be regarded as self-marketing. As the users of dating apps come from diverse backgrounds, we are interested in how users from distinct backgrounds take different approaches to make themselves more memorable. Moreover, we design the framework of scoring users’ self-introduction and algorithm for providing writing tips (such as words for being memorable). Although our project is still preliminary, it has gained a lot of interest among our friends who struggle to find a date online. Also, our methods and analysis have the potential to be adopted by the dating website to improve the users’ experience and better achieve their mission as matchmakers. 

# Literature Review

Self-concept and self-representation have long served as grounds of debate in cognitive and positive psychology [@bruning1999cognitive] as well as social anthropology [@goffman1975presentation]. The recent spread of social networking and its specific affordances have allowed individuals to build different online ‘selves’ [@papacharissi2010networked]. One such critical scenario may be that of mate selection, which several economists and sociologists have likened this to ‘marriage marketplace’ [@hitsch2010matching]. Several online dating service providers in developed countries may facilitate the expansion of potential mates beyond the limits of even extended offline social networks @cacioppo2013marital assert that as many as one in three marriages in the United States is facilitated through these portals. @heino2010relationshopping argue that these avenues further entrench the economic dimension through an acute, implicit awareness of ‘relationshopping’. Herein, potential partners are reduced to entries in a catalog to be scrolled through. In this sense, they suggest an emerging conscientiousness of ‘marketing’, with the product being themselves, and the potential mate assuming the role of a buyer (ibid). This perception thus links the private worlds of romantic intimacy with those of mass consumption and broader perceived appeal to the opposite sex. 

Potentially, we will also use some marketing theories to understand our findings. Selling themselves and finding a mate on OkCupid is not very different from selling a product on eBay. Economists have been interested in the matching problem of demand and supply, such as @hitsch2010matching. Since we do not have data on users’ interactions, we will focus primarily on understanding how people brand themselves to stand out in a crowd. For example, brand awareness is a key metric in marketing to quantify the degree to which people recall or recognize a brand. A high level of brand awareness helps a product stand out and get chosen when consumers face many alternatives. 

This could be applied to understand online dating. Let us imagine your future mate uses the filter to narrow down the consideration sets. He/She might still face many similar choices with high matching scores to choose from. If you want to stand out from the pool, you must make yourself memorable by highlighting the uniqueness. Thus, one possible idea in this project is to explore and understand how users could increase their brand awareness and differentiate themselves in their segments

# Empirical Strategy

# Analysis & Results

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Descriptive Statistics

```{r descr-stats-demo, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
original_data = read_csv(here("Data", "final_okcupid.csv"))
skim_list = original_data %>% select(-c(dbscan_cluster)) %>% skim() %>% partition()

skim_list$numeric %>% select(-hist) %>% mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 2) %>% kable(caption = "Continuous Variables")
skim_list$character%>% kable(caption = "Other Variables")

original_data %>% mutate_if(is.character, factor) %>% mutate_all(as.numeric) %>% cor(use = "pairwise.complete.obs") %>% ggcorrplot() + labs(title = "Correlation Plot of Demographic Variables")
```

### Visual Analysis

```{r viz-analysis, echo=FALSE}
cat_vars = original_data %>% 
  select(edu, fit, height_group, race_ethnicity) %>% 
  mutate_all(factor) %>% 
  pivot_longer(dplyr::everything()) %>% 
  table() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(area = n, fill = value, label = value)) + 
  geom_treemap() + 
  geom_treemap_text(color = "white", place = "centre", grow = TRUE) + 
  facet_wrap(~ name) + theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(title = "Categorical Variable Distributions")

original_data %>% select(-new_index, -orig_index, -age, -height, -clean_text, -essay9, -dbscan_cluster, -profile_length, -prop_longwords) %>% pivot_longer(-c(flesch, long_words)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = log(flesch + abs(min(flesch)) + 1), y = long_words, color = value)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3, size = 1) + facet_wrap(~ name) + theme(legend.position = "none") + labs(title = "Flesch score vs. Long words by Variable", x = "Flesch Score (log)", y = "Number of Long Words")
```


### Clusterability

## Clustering of Demographic Data

### K-means

### AGNES

Agglomerative Nesting was used to cluster the demographic data with a bottom-up approach to contrast the K-means clustering. As an AGNES model would not complete on the full data-set, a subset of 2000 observations was used instead.  

## Text Analysis

### Word2Vec

### Topic Modeling

### DBSCAN

A DBSCAN model was used to detect outliers within a data-set of 50 vectors calculated by Doc2Vec.

## Combining Text and Demographic Data


## Output



<img width="30%" src="preference_selection.png"/>
<img width="30%" src="profile_help.png"/>
<img width="30%" src="profile_help_fixed.png"/>

The above three pictures show the protocol of the final product that we have in mind. The protocol uses the example of Li (one of the project members), although the information is hypothetical. The first picture displays his demographic information and a short self-introduction. The second picture shows that the new algorithm highlights the common and memorable words by comparing them with the frequencies among his peers. He also gets a score of 63 and some tips on improving the writing. The third picture is the revised version of previous writing, which now Li has a memorable self-introduction with an increased score of 87. He should be confident to reach out to other users on OkCupid now. 


## Discussion

The project faces several limitations at this stage. Firstly, without data on the outcome (such as the number of messages), we do not know have a relative measure for the self-introductions' memorabilities. As a result, we don't have the outcomes to train the scoring function with machine learning. Secondly, without follow-up interviews, we cannot measure whether the specific choice of words was aimed at authenticity or matches with an awareness of 'relationshopping' (experienced users use certain phrases fraudulently to hook others). Thirdly, without the users' other profile images, we cannot estimate the effect of a memorable self-introduction on outcomes as the quality of images is a potential moderating variable.

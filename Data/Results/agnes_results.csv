is it supporting us in being who we want to be? can wemake adjustments to see that it does and are we willing to do so?whether for a week, a month, a year or decades, i come intorelationship when the two of us believe and experience that doingso takes us closer to our values. i end relationship when i do notsee or experience this for both people. i do not consider death tobe a failure and appreciate the vitality that comes from honestlyexploring the question: does spending time together each day bringus more value than any other thing we could be doing? if not, whynot? are we ok with that or do we want to reinvent our relationshipso that it does? immediacy is a very high value of mine. somethingthat is true and gets communicated while i'm feeling it is a greatexperience. within the next 24 hours it's ok and beyond that itbegins to feel stale and intimacy starts to diminish.appreciation and affection: my first three love languages in thisorder are: words of praise, quality time and touch. to feel loved ineed verbal appreciation, spacious time to connect and touch.because i get a fairly good read on someone within a few hours i amoften fairly fast with affection if i feel safe and it is nice tobe met there. i enjoy leisurely relationships in which we take thetime each day to appreciate what we love about one another and toenjoy sexual and sensual affection. i notice that i don't have acourting and honeymoon stage that wears off. i am just asaffectionate several years into a relationship as i am at thebeginning  sometimes more so because i get turned on more byemotional closeness than i do by anything else.personal growth and spirituality: i am passionate about learningexceptional relationship skills and have published several books onthe subject as part of my own education (i learn best by teaching).it was an incredible discovery when i experienced natural sacredstates of insight and consciousness arising out of bringing ourenergy bodies into love-making. i have learned so much in the pasteight years since i made relationship skills the focus of mylife-long learning program. i want to meet someone who shares mypassion to learn and experience new things on all dimensions. ihave always found i learn best with beginner's mind. i appreciateyou for joining me there.","you have time in the next three days to meet, video chat or sharean open-ended call. i'm looking forward to getting to know youbeneath the surface.warmly,dane",white,73,High School or less,not_fit,White,not_short,179,11.791999999999998,1

no. it is, however, an instant andviolent reaction, which is a lot like a strong allergy. the pointis that if i go into a restaurant, it is much easier for me to sayto the server ""could you please make sure there are no onions ortomatoes in that chili, because i am allergic to them"", and muchmore likely to get me the kind of food i need, than if i just say""no tomatoes or onions, please, because i don't like them"" becauseallergies are much more legitimate than preferences. see what i didwith the elaborate metaphor there? similarly, i am not really poly,in that i am not looking for a multiple-partner relationship witheveryone involved being important to everyone else and committed tothe idea that all of us need to be in love, to one degree oranother, with each other. i might be open to that if the rightbunch of people came along, but i am not actually here shopping forit. what i am, more accurately, is a fundamentally non-monogamousperson, in that i believe that sex and love are not interchangeableand that, even if i love you - which i will - commitment does notequal, compel or imply monogamy. i am not opposed to monogamy inprinciple or in the world, but i have tried it and it wasn't mybag. if you like the look of me, and you want to go out with me,but you are monogamous, you are welcome to try and sway me to yourpoint of view; i will listen, but the chances are good it's notgoing to take. there is a lot more to say about that, but it is notespecially funny or necessary, so i will leave its explication forfurther interactions.thanks to the good offices of okcupid, i now have the lovely,talented and sweet viewmenu. this changes nothing as far as mystance on poly and nonmonogamous relationships is concerned. thepractical upshot - if you want to hook up with me right now,it probably won't happen. if you want to contact me knowing that iam in a stable long-term relationship that doesn't preclude usenjoying each other's company, or if you're looking for a fun,smart couple, your chances are much better. if that appeals to you,or if you just want to make a couple of friends, well - lector,circumspice..what does this mean for you, the woman on the street?

patriarchy of monotheism that isintended to control my higher, conscious brain functions. reducingthe complexity, and mystery, of life to monotheism, offerscertainty at the price of deliberate delusion. it's much moreinteresting to acknowledge the truth of it, that no one has a cluewhat all this is about. not knowing, we are poised to experiencethe real as we are open to possibilities. moreover, we are free todefine and inject, or reject, meaning. what we do is an expressionof what is important, and we are free to do this, or to do that.anxiety is not a necessary concomitant of

so.---------------i want to make the world a better place, as it has been made betterby others, and as many others are doing so now. the centralproblems of justice and human dignity are structural, notcosmetic.--------------in our culture, economic success is proportional to exploitation.the larger the bank account, the larger the pool of exploitedlabor. people carry about a set of self-images and have a sense ofethics, thus the necessity for a doctrine (stories we tellourselves) defending the indefensible exploitation. everyhierarchical power system comes with an instruction manual,indoctrination, elevating the ""haves"" upon the pedestal of""success"" and ""superiority"" while teaching contempt for thehave-nots.why does this matter? because the economic system puts us in apsychological bind. gaining wealth feels good because it offers afalse sense of self-esteem. people who ""succeed"" are, indeed,performing well on all indicators and measures. one can measureefficiency and productivity. corporations measure and rankemployees just as my third-grade teacher measured and ranked usstudents.a problem arises only when reality interferes with the system ofrewards and punishments. that reality introduces cognitivedissonance demanding resolution. some people drink to kill thereality. others dive into a vast variety of denials and delusionsthat are provided in the ""instruction manual"" of exploitation. theprimary purpose of public education is to indoctrinate the younginto the economic system.every so often, the exploited are successful. for them, success isnot joining the entrepreneurial club, but rather, success isdefined by breaking through the doctrinal system (internally first,then culturally second) to eliminate or at least reduce, theexploitation. much of human history for the past ten thousand yearsis characterized by cycles of elite control, suppression, andindoctrination, followed by phases of enlightenment, insight,culminating in rebellion.every horrible system of economic exploitation, in the past---usslavery, emperors and empire, monarchy, stalinism--was justified bycomplex doctrines, justifying the unjustifiable. we look back inhorror.the most difficult task of the living is to understand and toexperience the modern world for what it is---another system ofexploitation accompanied by complex doctrine justifying theunjustifiable. the modern corporate-state economic and politicalsystem is one more in the continuing series of human social systemsfounded upon exploitation. some systems of exploitation are lessonerous than others, but we humans have not completed the struggleto achieve justice and equality.some turn to alcohol, some turn to religion (and ""spirituality""whatever that is), some turn to the instruction manual for thelatest justification for why wall street bankers have millionswhile millions of other people have nothing, some turn to art, someturn to drugs, some turn to tv, some turn to sports, some turn toshopping, some turn to sex, some turn to... many paths lead todiversion and denial. the elite support and encourage yoga, whilevilifiying the truth-telliers such as wikileaks. our system isprofoundly problematic because it offers massive cash rewards forthrowing away one's personal integrity, while requiring massivelayers of self-delusion (lies), and violence. every system ofexploitation manifests itself in violence. mostly directed atothers, but sometimes directed at one's self. the conundrum ofconcentrated power and wealth offers no escape. no exit.concentrated power is perverse. it's a perversion comprised ofpride generated from domination and exploitation. it's overtlysocially destructive, and self-destructive. now, it's leading tothe destruction of the habitability of the planet and perhaps todestruction, the end, of the species. coming to terms with thedestructive character of corporate capitalism is our currentchallenge.to return to the personal, money and power feel good when it's heldwithin a cultural context that offers social capital--socialrewards---for ""success."" money and power feel bad when it'sattained within a cultural context wherein the shared value systemdisdains exploitation. people act in a manner in accordance withthe social value system. change is forged when economic ""success""is recognized for the exploitation that it is, thus becomingmorally reprehensible. this brings us back to the critical functionof the ""instruction manual"" and public schools, and the manner inwhich each individual resolves the internal moral quandary.to end exploitation is to reject the dominant, and domineering,value system. slavery was ended though violent rejection ofexploitation. sometimes rejection of exploitation can be achievednonviolently, as is the ongoing example in egypt. how and when we,in the us, will publicly resolve the exploitation inherent withinour own economic system, founded on corporate-state-capitalism,remains to be seen.---------------""resist much; obey little"" ~edward abbey.---------------i could be a ""canadian dreamer."" i'd
